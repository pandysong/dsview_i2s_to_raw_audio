# dsviewi2s

A simple tool to convert the data exported from DSView to raw audio file which
could be imported to Audacity.

# Rational

DSView as of now has no function to decode the I2S data, this tool is used to
convert the data to raw audio file.

# How to Install

After clone this repo, in the `dsview2is` directory:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

This will install the tool `dsview2is` as well as its dependencies and add the
`dsview2is` to your "PATH".

# How to use

Using DSView to capture the data, and export data to csv file

The file looks like:

```
Id,Time[s],IÂ²S
0,4.82e-06,Left channel: 00007df3
1,1.54e-05,Right channel: 00000651
2,2.582e-05,Left channel: 00000651
3,3.624e-05,Right channel: 00000e93
4,4.666e-05,Left channel: 00000e93
5,5.708e-05,Right channel: 00001695
6,6.75e-05,Left channel: 00001695
7,7.792e-05,Right channel: 00001e35
```

Usage:

```
Usage: dsviewi2s <left|right> < file_exported_from_ds_view > <raw_audio_file>
```

Following command convert left channel in the csv file to audio.bin
```
dsviewi2s left DSLogic-la-200904-172721.csv audio.bin
```

# Notes

In DSView, the when capturing the data, it is important to understand that the
I2S data format on the I2S bus, in my case, the first clock is not used
(always 0), so we have to set the data length in DSView from 16bits to 17bits
in order to capture the full 16bits effective data. Otherwise the data capture
is not correct.
